# WORK IN PROGRESS #

# Homelab
Homelab IaC code

## It's a, mostly, manual deployment
I might make ansible playbooks for all this later.

## Notes
I have a VMWare ESXi with vCenter running, everything will be deployed on that.

## K8s folder is for ArgoCD managed deployments

# Docs contains info
- Provision Talos on vmware
- Deploy Cilium
- Bootstrap ArgoCD
- Sketchy setup of cert-manager (TOFIX)
